# Python Studies
## Preview

I have studied Python here by solving algorithms, but I decided my strength makes stronger and stronger. I think my strength is JAVA skill so far. However, recently, I am taking a class called "Intro to Algorithms", and the lecturer uses Python for the class. So you can check my progress [here](https://github.com/jsong00505/Udacity-Studies/tree/master/udacity-intro-to-algorithms).

Someday I will continue to study Python.
